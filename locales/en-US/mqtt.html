<script type="text/x-red" data-help-name="mqtt-in-dynamicsub">
    <p>Connects to a MQTT broker.
        Subscribes to messages from topics registered dynamically with the
        node.</p>
    <h3>Configuration</h3>
    <dl class="message-properties">
        <dt>Server</dt>
        <dd>The MQTT server configuration node used to subscribe and receive
            MQTT messages.</dd>
        <dt>QoS</dt>
        <dd><ul>
            <li><code>0</code>: fire and forget
            <li><code>1</code>: at least once
            <li><code>2</code>: once and once only.</ul></dd>
        <dt>Output</dt>
        <dd>The expected type of received MQTT payloads. If set to
            <code>auto-detect</code>, output as a string unless detected as a
            binary buffer.</dd>
        <dt>Unsubscribe from topic after first message received</dt>
        <dd>Set to automatically unsubscribe from any subscribed topic after
            receiving an MQTT message on that topic. Topics containing
            wildcards are not supported by this feature.</dd>
        <dt>Enable MQTT subscription debugging</dt>
        <dd>Set to log subscribe/unsubscribe requests in the debug log.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h3>Inputs</h3>
    <dl class="message-properties">
        <dt>topic <span text="required" class="badge">required</span><span class="property-type">string</span></dt>
        <dd>Topic to subscribe/unsubscribe to.</dd>
        <dt class="optional">unsubscribe <span class="property-type">boolean | string</span></dt>
        <dd><p>If set to <code>true</code>, then unsubscribe from the topic
            specified in <code>msg.topic</code>.
            If set to the string <code>"all"</code>, then unsubscribe
            from all currently subscribed topics. Otherwise, or if not set,
            subscribe to the specified topic.</p>
            <p>An error will be thrown if a subscribe request is received for
            an already subscribed topic, or for an unsubscribe request is
            received for a topic that is not currently subscribed.</p>
            <p>Node will not output on subscribe or unsubscribe.</p>
    </dl>

    <h3>Outputs</h3>
    <dl class="message-properties">
        <dt>payload <span class="property-type">string | buffer</span></dt>
        <dd>The MQTT payload with type in accordance with the
            <code>Output</code> node property.</dd>
        <dt>topic <span class="property-type">string</span></dt>
        <dd>The MQTT topic. Uses <code>/</code> as a hierarchy separator.</dd>
        <dt>qos <span class="property-type">number</span> </dt>
        <dd><ul>
            <li><code>0</code>: fire and forget
            <li><code>1</code>: at least once
            <li><code>2</code>: once and once only.</ul></dd>
        <dt>retain <span class="property-type">boolean</span></dt>
        <dd><code>true</code> indicates the message was marked as retained by
            the MQTT server, and the data may be stale.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h3>Node Context</h3>
    <dl class="message-properties">
        <dt>subscribed_topics<span class="property-type">list</span></dt>
        <dd>Contains a list of all currently subscribed topics.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h3>Details</h3>
    <p>This node requires a connection to a MQTT broker to be configured, which
        can be configured by clicking the pencil icon. Brokers that are
        configured for use by the built-in MQTT nodes can be used by this node.
        Multiple MQTT nodes can share the same broker connection.</p>

    Subscription topics can include MQTT wildcards:
    <ul>
        <li><code>+</code> for one level,
        <li><code>#</code> for multiple levels (can only be used at the end of
            a topic).
    </ul>

    <h3>In-band unsubscribe</h3>
    <p>If an MQTT message for a subscribed topic is received from the broker
        with a string payload in the format
        <code>_unsubscribe:<i>nodeName</i></code>
        (eg. <code>_unsubscribe:waitForResponse</code>), then any
        node(s) with a node name that matches <code><i>nodeName</i></code> will
        unsubscribe itself from that topic. No message will be output by this
        node on receipt of an in-band unsubscribe MQTT message.</p>
    <p>Topics containing wildcards cannot be unsubscribed via in-band
        unsubscribe MQTT messages.
